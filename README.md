# Modular-Baselines

Modular-Baselines is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library, based on [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), with the objective of improving flexibility and providing necessary components in RL Research. Components are framework agnostic in the sense that they do not rely on a specisifc framework. That said, Modular baselines includes both Pytorch and JAX implementations of some of the agents.
